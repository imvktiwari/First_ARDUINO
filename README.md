# First_ARDUINO

This project is based on ARDUINO CALCULATOR using Arduino Uno Board.
For this project I used : Arduino Uno Board , Breadboard , 4x4 Matrix Membrane Type Keypad , LCD1602 Module , Jumper Wires.



Seniors , I have been thinking about branch change so I could not focus on project till 19th of July.I thought to complete my project in Dhanbad itself but due to family problems I returned to my city on 20th July. Three days went in travelling.So I could not give 100% but i don't want to get thrown out of club.I talked to one of seniors at club who gave me new project on morsh code which I will submit within given time limits.
